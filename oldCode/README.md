# ENGR207 Final Project
This folder contains the old code that was used in the process of creating the final system in FinalProject.ipynb. As this code was originally in the main directory, the file paths in these notebooks will no longer work. If this old code is needed, the easiest way to run the code would be to move the file into the main directory.
